#### Hi, I am Min!

In the last semester of my graduate program, out of curiosity, I took a project-based business school course. 
I had an undergraduate background in psychology and was studying data analytics, so my academic background was far from product or entrepreneurship. 
My project team developed a new meal product targeting college students partnering with a large grocery chain based in PA. 
That experience opened my eyes to a whole new world. Upon graduation, eager to learn product and get hands-on experience, 
I decided to become a product analyst. Since then I have been working as a product analyst applying data insights to product development and strategy 
leveraging my technical and data skills. I’m naturally a people person. 
I enjoy cultivating relationships with people from different backgrounds, and in my free time, I often ponder why people behave and think the way they do.

This repo contains some of the projects I worked on as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.
